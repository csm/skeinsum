This is `skeinsum`, a command-line wrapper around the [Skein](http://www.schneier.com/skein.html) hash function, as implemented by the [Skein3Fish](https://github.com/wernerd/Skein3Fish) version by [wernerd](https://github.com/wernerd).

It is deliberately similar to the `sha1sum` command from GNU coreutils.
